SECTION 154.050: NONRESIDENTIAL DESIGN DISTRICT STANDARDS
The purpose and intent of these Design District Standards is to guide development
and redevelopment toward creating an interrelated and predictable pattern of
buildings, streetscapes, and landscapes that improve the aesthetics of the built
environment within Fruitland Park. To proactively prepare for impending growth the
City of Fruitland Park has undertaken the establishment of these standards that will
improve the image and appearance of all development. The basic premise is that
quality appearance will result in quality development.
Design standards also protect the community's investment. When the aesthetic
appearance of a community is maintained or improved, a sense of pride develops for
the residents, owners, and merchants. Further, design standards improve the City's
economic standing. In the absence of design standards, other areas in the region
may position themselves with a more competitive advantage to attract residents and
merchants. The City encourages economic growth and wants to provide a business
atmosphere where the private sector can flourish.
Meanwhile the City is tasked with protecting its existing neighborhoods and
businesses from the potential impacts of development. Special attention has been
placed on the creation of a quality, safe, and functional environment. Buffers,
landscaping, and building placement on a parcel can mitigate potential impacts to
surrounding properties.
These Design District Standards exhibit specific themes of expectations for
development within Fruitland Park. An interconnected transportation network and
pedestrian accessibility are primary concerns for new development and
redevelopment. Land should be developed by utilizing infrastructure and resources
efficiently. The City requires the design of new development to be visually sensitive
to surrounding development and the environment through architectural standards,
buffering, landscaping, and building placement.
a) Applicability of Design Standards
The Design District Standards cover all commercially zoned properties within
the City limits and the Joint Planning Area (JPA) between the City and Lake
County.
The design standards are applicable to nonresidential development and mixeduse development and redevelopment. The Design District Standards shall be
applicable if one or more of the following criteria are met:
1) Nonresidential Development:
A) The building floor area of a structure is being increased by more than
thirty percent (30%).
B) The property is subject to a change of use from residential to
nonresidential.
C) All Planned Developments (PD) and Developments of Regional
Impact (DRI).
2) Additional Provisions:
A) Section 154.060(e) (Colors) shall apply when the exterior of an existing
building or any portion thereof, including trims or accents, is repainted.
Section 154.060(e) shall apply even in those cases where no other
work is being conducted. A submission of the proposed color theme
including base, trim, and accent colors for approval by the
Community Development Director is required prior to the issuing of the
Commercial Structure Painting Permit. There is no charge for the
Commercial Structure Painting Permit.
SECTION 154.060: DESIGN STANDARDS
a) Landscape Buffers
A twenty-five foot (25') landscape buffer is required from the right-of-way.
A five foot (5') paved sidewalk is required within the established buffer
unless a sidewalk already exists. An additional path or trail may be required
by the City to accommodate alternative forms of transportation. For internal
streets, Florida Friendly Landscaping, including street trees, evergreen
shrubs, planter boxes, or other approved designs should be used between
the sidewalk and the travel lanes to buffer pedestrians from moving vehicles.
The buffer area is not to be utilized for stormwater management unless
approved by the Community Development Director due to severe constraints
of the site.
b) Big Box Stores
Big box stores, defined as any store which exceeds 50,000 square feet on
a single level, are permissible in the Design District.
c) Outparcels
Frequently, large shopping and business centers have a few uses that
develop stand-alone buildings, known as outparcels, at the perimeter of a
site adjacent to the public right-of-way. Large-scale developments that
have a primary building and/or anchor stores and secondary outparcels must
conform to the following standards:
1) Interconnection of pedestrian walkways with the main structure and
adjacent outparcels is required. Vehicular connection between
outparcels, the main structure, and adjacent outparcels is required to
provide for safe and convenient vehicular movement within a site.
2) Consolidated and shared parking is required to reduce the amount of
impervious surface.
d) Circulation and Access
Development shall be designed to minimize the interaction of vehicles with
pedestrians and bicyclists. Efficient and safe circulation systems for vehicles,
pedestrians, and bicyclists will be required for all developments.
Cross-access and shared access shall be required between individual uses.
Internal cross-access and shared use agreements for driveways shall be
used to facilitate access and connections between adjacent sites. Frontage
roads or service roads may also be considered to connect all parcels.
e) Drive-through Establishments
Drive-through lanes must be designed with pedestrian safety as the first
priority. Drive-through designs must have the same detail of the principal
structure and match the materials and roof of the principal structure.
A pass-through lane shall be required for all drive-through facilities. The
pass-through lane shall be constructed adjacent to the stacking lane(s) in
order to provide a way out of or around the stacking lane(s).
SECTION 154.070: BUILDING DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS
a) Building Facade
The front elevation of the building should be faced, with design features
that give it a more pedestrian scale appearance. Large-scale features such
as long uninterrupted storefront windows are to be avoided. The use of
mullions and dividers in large windows is encouraged. Large areas of blank
walls should be reserved for the rear of the building. Metal buildings are to be
faced with other materials to break up the purely metal facade.
When a building has elevations on more than one roadway or pedestrian
area, the City may require that each elevation maintains the dominant
theme of the main entrance.
The size, scale, materials and use of colors for the building facade design
should be kept constant across the entire building facade in order to tie the
complete composition together.
When using more than one material on the facade, it is recommended to
have one as the dominant theme with the others acting only to complement
or accentuate the design.
Architectural elements of the facade should be aligned with and compliment
the architectural elements on adjacent buildings to maintain the rhythm of the
block.
Entrances to smaller stores shall be recessed or framed by a sheltering
element such as an awning, arcade, porch or portico.
The primary entry to a building is the best place to be creative with the use
of depth in a facade. The added depth and articulation help to draw attention
to the entry and highlight it as an important place.
b) Roof Design
The roof design of the building should be in keeping with the overall scale of
the structure itself. Overly large, bold or inflated roof and fascia designs are
discouraged.
Flat roof structures should utilize recognizable cornice treatments and be
capped by an articulated parapet design that acts as a structural expression
of the building facade and its materials.
Sloped roof structures should maintain a pitch between a 5/12 minimum
and a 12/12 maximum on all primary roof areas. Buildings with sloped roofs
are encouraged to employ the use of dormers and reversed gables along the
front elevation to help maintain a prominent facade. Mansard and shed roof
designs are discouraged.
Air handling units, condensers, satellite dishes and other equipment placed
on the roof should be screened by building elements and not be visible from
the street.
The roof structure should be designed so as to divert rainwater from the
pedestrian areas such as walkways and doors. The use of canopies, awnings
or similar protective designs is also encouraged at entry locations.
Breaks and fluctuations in the roofline are encouraged to highlight important
areas of the building such as the main entrance and to break up longer runs
of the facade/roof area.
c) Materials
The use of brick, stone (cast and natural), split-faced concrete block, glass
block, ceramic tile and fiber cement horizontal lap siding or another material
if approved by the Community Development Director is required.
The use of decorative coursing and quoins in masonry walls is encouraged.
When making a transition from one material to the next, it is recommended
that the change occur at a hard edge or "bump out" in the facade.
Acceptable materials for sloped roofs include pre-finished metal, terracotta tile
and laminated 'architectural' asphalt shingles.
The following materials are discouraged in visible locations:
1) Corrugated or beveled metal siding
2) Corrugated fiberglass
3) Plywood, OSB or particleboard siding
4) Unfinished smooth concrete block
d) Lighting
Each building project will require the submission of an exterior Lighting Design
Plan.
Exterior lighting of the building and site should be designed so that light is not
directed off the site and the light source is to be shielded from direct offsite
viewing.
All exterior light fixtures should be fully shielded or be designed with light
angle cut-offs so as to eliminate spill light, trespass light and glare.
Down-lighting full building walls and roof lighting is prohibited.
Mounting height of pedestrian walkways should not exceed twelve feet (12')
with lower heights preferred.
The use of low, bollard-type fixtures mounted two feet (2') to four feet (4') in
height are encouraged for lighting pedestrian sidewalks and building
entrances.
Ensure that lighting enhances pedestrian safety.
e) Colors
The main color theme for a building should be of a natural, muted shade
with brighter colors used only to create accents.
When using multiple colors on the exterior of the building only one color
should be used as the main theme, with other colors used more sparingly to
create accents.
No more than three (3) different colors or color shades (one primary/body
color and no more than two accent/trim colors should typically be used on a
single building.
Prohibited colors include the use of intense, florescent or day-glow colors,
black as the predominant exterior color and monochromatic color schemes.
Colors that are determined to be garish, gaudy, loud, excessive and
ostentatious or that otherwise constitute a glaring and invasive contrast to
surrounding buildings shall be prohibited. A solid band of color or groups of
color shall not be used for architectural detail. </p>
