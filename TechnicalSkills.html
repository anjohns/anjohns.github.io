							<h1>Technical Skills and Experience</h1>
							<p></p>
							<h3>Statistical Analyses</h3>
							<p>I use a range of statistical tools to analyze ecological, behavioral, and microbiome data, working primarily in R and Python. My toolkit includes linear and generalized linear models, distribution fitting, and mixed-effects models, alongside exploratory data analysis and custom visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks. I also use machine learning methods, with a focus on tree-based libraries like XGBoost, LightGBM, and random forests. I often combine models into stacked ensembles to improve predictive power. These tools have been especially useful for uncovering patterns in complex biological systems where traditional assumptions break down.</p>
							
							<h3>Writing</h3>
							<p>I write for both technical and general audiences. My academic writing spans ecology, microbiology, and public health, including peer-reviewed articles and my dissertation on microbial community assembly and host-microbiome interactions. I also write essays and op-eds that translate scientific ideas into plain English, covering topics like biosafety, pandemic risk, and the design of healthier cities. My goal in every format is the same: to make complex ideas clear, grounded, and interesting.</p>
							
							<h3>Speaking</h3>
							<p>I’ve spoken on topics ranging from microbiome ecology to real estate zoning, with audiences that include scientists, economists, and advisory boards. Some talks have been highly technical, others geared toward policy or interdisciplinary groups. In every case, I aim to make the core ideas clear, grounded, and worth remembering—whether I’m presenting experimental results or helping connect ecological concepts to real-world systems.</p>
							
							<h3>Experimental Design</h3>
							<p>My training is rooted in designing rigorous, controlled experiments to answer ecological and microbiological questions. I’ve developed experimental systems that offer both realism and scalability, including a Drosophila-based platform for studying microbiome dynamics. My approach emphasizes tight control over confounding variables, high replication, and careful measurement—an experimental mindset that carries over into how I build models, interpret data, and frame broader scientific questions.</p>
