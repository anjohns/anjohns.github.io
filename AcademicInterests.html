							<h3>Ecology of Cities</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Roman city.jpg" alt="" /></span>Cities are complex systems, shaped by both physical infrastructure and human behavior. I’m drawn to the questions they raise: How do people move through a city, and how does the built environment guide those choices? How do other organisms, like rats, mosquitoes, viruses, move alongside them? Can we design infrastructure that keeps a city running, but also slows the spread of disease? I think these questions are both academically interesting and of immense pragmatic importance. Most people on Earth live in cities. Understanding how these systems work could be a key way to improve public health, resilience, and everyday life.</p>
							
							<h3>Ecology of the Gut Microbiome</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/SEM microbiome.jpg" alt="" /></span>The gut microbiome is an incredibly complex ecosystem, populated by and array of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and host cells, all competing and cooperating in close quarters. Most microbiome research has focused on what different microbiome profiles mean for host health. Far less attention has been paid to how these communities form, shift, and stabilize. My work brings an ecological lens to the problem. Using fruit flies, I built an experimental system where each fly's gut acts as an independent ecosystem—-allowing us to run high-replication experiments that would be impossible in a forest or grassland. It’s a powerful tool for studying the microbiome, but also for testing ideas in community ecology that have been hard to examine at scale. </p>
							
							<h3>Biological Security, Defense, and Safety</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/black plague painting.jpg" alt="" /></span>Technologies that were once accessible only to a few leading labs are now widely available, inexpensive, and spreading quickly. Our ability to manipulate life is growing faster than our ability to regulate it. I believe biologists have a moral responsibility to help society catch up. This requires a closer collaboration between scientists and policy makers. Biotechnology must be made safer, and the community must help ensure responsible use. Policymakers need expert guidance. Scientists need to take ownership of the risks their work creates. The stakes are incredibly high and increasing every year.</p>
