							<h3>Ecology of Cities</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Roman city.jpg" alt="" /></span>Cities are complex systems, shaped by both physical infrastructure and human behavior. I’m drawn to the questions they raise: How do people move through a city, and how does the built environment guide those choices? How do other species—rats, mosquitoes, viruses—move alongside them, exploiting the same networks? Can we design infrastructure that doesn’t just serve people, but also slows the spread of disease? For me, cities are more than just a backdrop. They’re a source of intellectual fascination and practical urgency. Most people on Earth live in urban areas. Understanding how cities work is one of the most powerful ways to improve public health, resilience, and everyday life.</p>
							
							<h3>Ecology of the Gut Microbiome</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/SEM microbiome.jpg" alt="" /></span>The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem, home to bacteria, fungi, viruses, and host cells all competing and cooperating in close quarters. It’s been a hot topic for the past decade, but most research has focused on what different microbiomes mean for host health. Far less attention has been paid to how these communities form, shift, and stabilize. My work brings an ecological lens to the problem. Using fruit flies, I built a system where every gut acts as an independent ecosystem—allowing us to run high-replication experiments that would be impossible in a forest or grassland. It’s a powerful tool for studying the microbiome, but also for testing ideas in community ecology that have been hard to examine at scale. </p>
							
							<h3>Biological Security, Defense, and Safety</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/black plague painting.jpg" alt="" /></span>The 21st century is the century of biology. Technologies that were once accessible only to a few leading labs are now widely available, inexpensive, and spreading quickly. Our ability to manipulate life is growing faster than our ability to regulate it. Biologists have a moral responsibility to help society catch up—to make these tools safer, and to ensure they are used with care. That will require closer collaboration between science and policy. Policymakers need expert guidance, and scientists need to take ownership of the risks their work creates. The problems ahead are complex, and the stakes are high. We need more biologists not just at the bench, but at the table.</p>
