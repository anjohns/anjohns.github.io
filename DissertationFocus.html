							<h3>Community Ecology of the Gut Microbiome</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/drosophila painting.jpg" alt="" /></span>I study the gut microbiome through the lens of ecology, using Drosophila as a model to test how microbial communities form, stabilize, and influence their host. Each fly gut acts as a miniature ecosystem—letting me ask big ecological questions with the kind of replication most field systems could never offer. This work draws on classical ideas in competition, habitat quality, and niche theory, and it helps make sense of the rules that govern microbial life inside animals.</p>
							<p>The first chapter of my dissertation focuses on competition between closely related bacterial species. Using a controlled system, I introduced a focal Acetobacter species alone or alongside a second, genetically distinct Acetobacter. The results were clear: closely related species were less likely to coexist. The more similar the pair, the more likely one species was to outcompete the other. But when the two species were identical, they often persisted together—suggesting a threshold where niche overlap disappears and neutrality takes over. These dynamics mirror classic patterns in community ecology, but with the added power of microbial control and replication. </p>
							<p>In the second chapter, I turned to the role of habitat quality. Not all guts are the same, even in genetically identical flies. I showed that small, often-overlooked differences in the host environment—such as microbial load or nutrient levels—can shape which species thrive. By focusing on intra-treatment variability rather than engineered extremes, I was able to isolate the ecological effects of habitat quality from other confounding factors. The findings point to a central role for subtle environmental variation in determining community structure. </p>
							<p>The third chapter explores how the gut microbiome influences host behavior. Using gnotobiotic flies with specific bacterial communities, I found that female mating preferences shift depending on which microbes are present. Some combinations changed how often females mated, others affected mating duration. These effects weren’t explained by a single bacterial species, but by interactions between them. It’s a reminder that even traits as complex as behavior can be shaped by the tiny communities living inside us—and that microbiomes may play a larger role in evolutionary processes than we’ve assumed. </p>
